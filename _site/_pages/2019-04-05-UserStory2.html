<h3 id="adding-or-creating-new-user-account">Adding or creating new user account</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Enter the new user’s <strong>Login Name</strong> and the initial <strong>Password</strong></li>
  <li>(Optional) Assign <strong>Groups</strong> membership</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Create</strong> button</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Login names may contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), dashes (-), underscores (_), periods (.), and at signs (@). ownCloud usernames cannot be changed. These are user’s permanent-owned cloud user IDs. However, user’s <strong>Full Name</strong> can be changed. The admin can also edit the passwords and can change group assignments as and when needed. This is a useful mechanism for delegating some admin chores and also enabling groups to manage themselves.</p>

<p>After creating the user, you may fill in their <strong>Full Name</strong> if it is different from the login name or you can leave it for the user to complete.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Press <em>Ctrl-R</em> to refresh the page. This is done to make sure your new entry is visible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To summarize, the steps involved in creating or adding a new user are entering a name and password and delegating the user to a group. The new user can now log in to the ownCloud server and start collaborating with other users.</p>
